# CAST---Cyber-Attack-Simulation-Toolkit
CAST (Cyber Attack Simulation Toolkit) is a platform that allows users to configure, run, and analyze simulated cyberattacks in a controlled environment. It provides real-time telemetry, detailed reports, and data visualization to help users understand system vulnerabilities and improve security defenses.

This is the GitHub repository for the CAST project. 

Features that are being developed will not be committed to the main branch and will be committed to the feature_branch until they are ready to be committed to the main branch.
